# edepViewer
An external event viewer for edepsim.  
I am in the process of uploading this library and expect to add a license and more complete readme later today.  

Develop branch, which needs to be merged into master, currently depends on edepsim, gtkmm (LGPL license), 
tinyxml2 (still researching license), CERN's ROOT library (LGPL license), glm (modified MIT license), and 
includes files generated by the online glad interface which claims that its' files are in the public domain.  
Unless I find some license terms I am not expecting, I plan to release this library under the MIT license.
